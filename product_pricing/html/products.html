              <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
              On the outside the PS4 may be a simple black box, but underneath the hood it's all next-gen muscle. The console has 10 times the processing power of the PS3, thanks to some fancy hardware. The system features 8 GB of GDDR5 RAM, an 8-core x86 CPU, and a blazing fast GPU processor by AMD. Games are now capable of up to 60 frames per second (that makes for some smooth gameplay) and outputs up to a native 1080p resolution. The PS4 also features a user upgradable 500 GB hard drive, HDMI out, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, two USB 3.0 ports, and, of course, a Blu-ray/DVD player. Users can even charge controllers while the unit is in standby. Let's just say wow, and move on.

              Experience a deep sense of immersion with the Sony DualSense Wireless Controller, which is specially designed for the PlayStation 5 gaming console. In addition to having responsive game buttons, dual analog sticks, a D-pad, and a clickable 2-point capacitive touch pad, the DualSense enhances supported gaming experiences with vibrational haptic feedback that allow you to feel various effects, bumps, and surface textures. The adaptive triggers feature dynamic resistance levels that are designed to accurately simulate the impacts and pressures of in-game objects and activities such as pulling back a bow and feeling the trigger differences when switching . Additionally, the six-axis motion sensing system can control supported games by simply moving the wireless controller in different directions. Keep in close communication with teammates and friends using the controller's integrated microphone array and mono speaker. Alternatively, you can connect a headset to the audio jack for better clarity. The DualSense Wireless Controller connects to your PlayStation 5 via Bluetooth 5.1 or through a USB Type-C cable, which charges its built-in 1560mAh lithium-ion battery.
